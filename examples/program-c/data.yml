# data segment codes:
# 0x00 : reserved ...
# 0x0e : address of entry point
# 0x0f : count of globals in program
# 0x10 : count of constants in program, followed by consts
# 0x11 : type code of function signature

# zero globals in program
- !hex 0f
- !i16be 0

# fns signatures appear in const list and are encoded like:
#  code, address, arg-count, locals count, name bytes count, name bytes

# begin list of constants
- !hex 0x10
# of which there is just one
- !i16be 1

# square = (number)
- !hex 11   # type (fn)
- !ui16be 7 # code address
- !ui16be 1 # one argument
- !ui16be 0 # no local variables
- !ui16be 6 # name length
- !utf8 square
